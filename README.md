##mobx-react-note-example

The goal of this simple react application would be a good boiler plate with examples and test.

### Run the example

```
npm install
npm start
```

Browser should open automatically. Otherwise, navigate to the URL reported in the terminal

### Testing

```
npm install
npm test
```

### Credits

- [Mendix](http://github.com/mendix) for providing the opportunity to battle test this approach (we're hiring!).

### TODO

- Restructure and clean code.
- Determine Component test.
